# Data Encoding Techniques Application

This application provides a visual demonstration of various data encoding techniques, helping users understand the differences and characteristics of each method. The supported encoding techniques include:

- **NRZ-L (Non-Return-to-Zero-Level)**
- **NRZ-I (Non-Return-to-Zero-Inverted)**
- **Bipolar AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion)**
- **Pseudoternary**
- **Manchester Encoding**
- **Differential Manchester Encoding**

The application is built with:
- **Python** for the main logic
- **CustomTkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI)
- **Matplotlib** for data plotting

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to this repository: [Data-Encoding-Techniques](https://github.com/ElijahFernandez/Data-Encoding-Techniques/tree/main).
2. Go to the following directory: `dist`.
3. Locate and download the file named `FernandezJoseElijah_LabExer9.exe`.
4. Run `ctk2.exe` to launch the application.

## Features

- Visual representation of each encoding technique
- Interactive GUI for ease of use
- Simple and intuitive design to aid learning and demonstration of encoding techniques

Feel free to explore, experiment, and visualize the effects of different data encoding techniques!
